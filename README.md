Project name: Leveraging Tweets for Rapid Disaster Response Using BERT-BiLSTM-CNN model

Description: This project focuses on categorizing tweets related to natural disasters on Twitter aiming to identify informative tweets related to natural disasters on Twitter by distinguishing them from non-disaster tweets that mention disaster phrases without discussing the event itself utilizing a combination of contextual embeddings (BERT), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The research addresses the challenges of short and sparse text found in tweets and aims to enhance the accuracy of multi-label classification. This study is unique in its approach, as it combines BERT embedding with BiLSTM and Text CNN, offering a novel method for tweet classification.
